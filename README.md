I'm coming from a background in science and engineering I've always had a interest in tech and computer hardware. 
During a knee injury that kept me out of employment I had the opportunity to improve my IT skills when I was unable to travel to work.
 
My real passions for DevOps was born from containerization and automation in my three month DevOps training and work experience with QA Consulting.
